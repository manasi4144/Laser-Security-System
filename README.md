# Laser Security System

## Goal
An embedded system which detects object movement and stores entry/exit data. This system has a wider scope of applications including the ability to store the entry/exit data of people in a bus, elevator, bank and much more. 

## Tools
C, GPIO Handles, Raspberry Pi, Laser and Photo Diodes, Wires, Battery, Watchdog Timer, Unit File

## Additional Information 
This system is primarily implemented through two lasers and two photodiodes acting as the "doors", and the number of times the beams of the lasers are broken further. Using GPIO handles and diodes, the C code reads the value generated by the specific diode depending on the voltage to determine if the beam is broken or not. An unit file to run thye program to ensure that the system can easily recover from any malfunctions in the software.
